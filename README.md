-Problem-

  | Traditional textbooks lack hands-on and visual components that can contribute significantly to  student's education
  
  | Students who are new to physics that consider themselves hands-on or visual learners are at a disadvantage when their resources are limited to books

-Solution-

  | Provide Students a supplementative resource that provides a hands-on and visual element
  
  
-Project's Functionality-

  | Offers Students the ability to create objects
  
  | Students can edit the value of each object's property such as its position, velocity, acceleration, mass, and time
  
    *By editing the object's properties, students can observe how each of the object's properties affects its behavior in space*
    
  | Students can edit the value of the environment's property such as scale, gravity, and time
  
  | BONUS FEATURES:
  
    *Numbers in the simulation is accurate
    
    *Help info button on the top right

-Final Message-

Remembering my first physics class, I understand how difficult it can be to learn physics. While its easy to memorize formulas and plug in numbers, being able to truly understand
why those formulas work is crucial in order to truly learn the subject. I hope this project can help a struggling physics student understand why those formulas work and develop
a deeper understanding of 2-Dimensional Kinematics Motion. Thank you for taking a look at my project (If you are a new physics students learning kinematics, I hope this helps :D)
